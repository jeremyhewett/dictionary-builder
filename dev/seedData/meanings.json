In the latter, <i>Creamo</i> is presented without explanation, indicating that consumers were familiar with the term. <i>Creamo</i> was also the brand name of a breakfast cereal produced in post-WWI Alberta (see Image 3). Today, <i>creamo</i> competes with <i>cream</i>, <i>coffee cream</i>,  <i>half and half</i>, and <i>cereal cream</i> among other terms, and shows some decline in use, though about 40 percent of Vancouverites still report using the term. Among the immigrant and working class population, <i>creamo</i> is used more frequently (see Dollinger 2012a). While the term is most popular in BC, it is much less frequently used than <i>coffee cream</i> today. <i>Coffee cream</i> is the preferred term in all Canadian provinces except Prince Edward Island, where <i>table cream</i> prevails, and Manitoba, where <i>cereal cream</i> is ahead by a slight margin (see Chart 2).",

In Canada, the term is often used in contrast with those whose mother tongue is English (see <i>anglophone</i>). Thus, the word <i>francophone</i> is often used to describe a French Canadian (see the 1976 quotation). The term is said to derive from French, combining the terms \"franco\" and \"phone\", associated with 'French' and 'sound', respectively (see OED-3, s.v. \"francophone\").\n\n<br>The earliest Canadian attestation of the term discusses <i>francophones</i> in a Moroccan context, written by a reporter for a London newspaper. Moreover, OED-3's earliest attestation dates back to a 1900 source from the US (see OED-3, s.v. \"francophone\" (1)). This international presence highlights the term's evident semantic narrowing, from French speakers in general to French speakers in Canada. Resonance of the term in a Canadian context (see the 1968 quotation) coincides with Canada's federal movement in the mid to late 1960s towards English-French bilingualism (see <i>Canadian Encyclopedia</i> reference). As seen in Chart 1, the term is most frequently used in Canada. \nSee also COD-2, s.v. \"francophone\" (noun), which is marked \"Cdn\" and Gage-3, s.v. \"francophone\" (1), which is marked \"Cdn.\"",

The term is most frequently used in Quebec and British Columbia (see Chart 1), which stand out in the Canadian context for a number of variables. As <i>coffee cream</i> is also commonly used internationally (see Chart 3), the term is only Canadian in the sense that it is a Canadian regionalism in Quebec and BC. In BC, it might be a reflection of (older) British use, while in  Quebec its use is possibly influenced by the Quebec French (and French French) term \"crème à café\". This influence from French similarly appears to account for the higher frequency of \"sofa\" in Quebec as compared to \"couch\" in the rest of Canada (Dollinger 2015b: 292-3).\n<br>Canadian packaging regulations require the percentage of milk fat to be prominently displayed beside whatever name is given on the package.

It appears that people on PEI use <i>table cream</i> more frequently than the competing variants <i>coffee cream</i> or <i>cereal cream</i> (see Chart 1). In everyday speech, the term is a generalization to any kind of cream that one puts into coffee or tea, which may or may not be <i>table cream</i> in the strict sense of the word. This use is likely a preservation: as creams with less fat content became more widespread in Canada, PEIers transferred the older name to the new products, as the 1985 quotation suggests. In other provinces, however, other terms were adopted (e.g., in BC the term <i>creamo</i>).\n<br>The term is not listed in DPEIE.",
