According to the Treasury Board, a 'francophone' is a person whose mother tongue is French, presumably a French Canadian in most cases; thus, in a statement to the House of Commons in March, 1971, Drury was able to announce a policy of â??accelerated recruitment of francophones to the public serviceâ?�. (The passionate uproar that followed a discovery of a â??secretâ?� document purporting of hire 250 Quebec students indicates how popular this policy was in English Ottawa!) However, the Public Service Commission, responsible for all actual recruiting for the service, is forbidden by law to hire on racial grounds.  So <u>their</u> definition of a â??francophoneâ?� is, any person who can â??work creatively inFrenchâ?�.  When is an anglophone a francophone?  Where is a francophone an anglophone?  What is Jean Dupont, a hypothetical Ontarian, who grew up with both languages or perhaps with English only?  Or Michel X, whose personal language is French, but, after long years of exposure, prefers to work in English? â?¦",

In 1990-91, four school boards on the island reported that 35% of their student population was Allophone (speaking neither French or English), and almost half of the schools on the Island of Montreal reported an Allophone population of over 25%. It can now be said, and with a fair degree of certainty, that Bill 101 has achieved its overt aim: earlier enrollment trends have been reversed and minority students are increasingly enrolled in French, rather than English, language schools. At the present time, seventy percent of the Allophone student population, and more than 90% of the children of newly arrived immigrants attend French schools, as compared to 11% at the beginning of the 1970s (CSIM, 1991). Furthermore, recently observed trends suggest that factors other than the coercitive measures of Bill 101 are contributing to attendance in French language schools. For example, an important number of Anglophone and Allophone children, who have a legal right to English language schooling, have voluntarily chosen to attend French language schools (8516 in 1993).(f.4) Similarly, in 1986, more than 83% of Allophones graduating from French high schools chose to continue their education in French post-secondary institutions (CLF, 1991).",

Compounding the challenge is francophone Quebec's tumbling birth rate. It is a problem that the Parti Quebecois sought to address in its 1977 French Language Charter known as Bill 101, which required all nonanglophone immigrants -- and even some anglophones -- to attend French-language schools. But that measure has had an unintended result: many French schools are now dominated by nonfrancophone students, dubbed allophones.",

They frequently cite Quebec's December, 1988, ban on the use of languages other than French on outdoor commercial signs. Indeed, Filmon himself withdrew his support for the Meech Lake accord following the introduction of that law. \"It is scary that laws like that now apply in Canada,\" said Arthur Gunn, who operates Winnipeg's famed Gunn's Bakery, which his parents, immigrants from Poland, founded in 1937. Gunn also criticized a proposal before the Montreal Catholic School Commission to ban \"allophone\" students -- those whose mother tongue is neither English nor French -- from speaking languages other than French on school property. He added, \"When immigrant kids are forbidden to speak English in Montreal playgrounds, that is not a free Canada.\"",
